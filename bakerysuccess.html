        <div class="question-1"><p id="change">You got something to eat. That’s pretty impressive for you. Now you have proof that you’re a contributing member of society! I would say good job, but it seems pretty lackluster of a task to deserve such praise. Good to know that the only proof that you exist in this world will be shit away later. Even better, you’ll probably just toss it all together. Can’t stomach food anymore, right? Too lazy to even take care of yourself? Maybe you should’ve just stayed inside.
